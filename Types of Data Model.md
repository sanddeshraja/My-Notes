1. Hierarchical Database Model :
                         inspired from tree bases structure format single root node  and other data is linked to the same and expand like a tree.

                        Only one parent to child.


```math
||{"id":58688666953}||


```
2. Network model : 
                    overcome drawbacks of above, works like a graph
                    looped Relationship between various data linked  to one another
                   A child may have more than 1 parent 

```math
||{"id":1520140457766}||


```
3. Entity Relationship Model :
                 breaks data into different components based on characterstics, in terms of entries and attributes
             - Entity - real world representation
             - Attributes - characterstics/behaviour
             - Relationship - logical representation between various entities involved in database creation
         
         [[Types of Relation]]

 4. Relation model : most used model  -> 2 dimensional model relationship between various tables having atleast  one commo  field.

  
5. **OBJECT Oriented Database Model** :   The increasing complexity of code in modern age, we try to create a real time scenarios, speciall in AI, ML or image processing.

 6. Cloud Database : type of database where data is stored in cloud/ virtua environment and executes over the cloud computing platform.
          Ex: SaaS, PaaS,...
