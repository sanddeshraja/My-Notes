1. Factors of 12 -1,2,3,4,6,12
2. Prime Factoriz. of 12 - divide by least prime nos till you hv only 1 - 3^1 mul 2^2
3. total nos of factor - power+1 -> 2 mul 3
4. sum of factors - (3^0+3^1) mul (2^0+2^1+2^2)
5. Counting Nos. of zeros:
         For Ex:
          8 mul 15 mul 23 mul 17 mul 25 mul 22
          then check for 2 pairs and 5 pairs since 2 mul 5 gives 0
          8 has 3 twos, 15 with 1 five....
