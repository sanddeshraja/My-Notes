#File-System
     - files are stored in hardware device
     - Organization of files and access to file whenever there is need is done by FILE-SYSTEM 
     - files are grouped into directories, they further contain other folders and files.
     - File System  handles functions like 
                                                          - Management
                                                          - File naming
                                                          - Giving access rules
    
	- Ex : NTFS - New Technology File System
                EXT - Extended File System
