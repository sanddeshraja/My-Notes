## Cloud

In simple terms, cloud computing is a global network of servers connected with the internet that combine together to form a huge hard drive. 

Different platforms

GCP-Google Cloud Platform
AWS- Amazon Web Services
Microsoft - Azure

Different type of cloud deployement model like

- Public Cloud
- Private Cloud
- Hybrid Cloud
- Community Cloud

AWS is a public cloud which works on pay-as-you-go billing modules
Public Clouds are managed by third parties which provide cloud services over the internet to the public 

## Cloud Computing 

it is internet based computing which is a shared pool of resources that is available over a broad network. Or in other terms. It means accessing the services of cloud on Pay as you go basis 
PAYG allows user to scale, customize or provision  computing resources, including software, storage and development platforms.
Resource charges are based on used services, versus an entire infrastructure

SaaS - Software as a service where a user leases Software and customized Features.

### ADV of Cloud Computing

- Data Backup
- Accessibility and Collaboration
- No Maintenance Cost
- Mobility
- Pay As you Go
- Unlimited Storage
- Data Security

### DIS of Cloud Computing

- Internet connectivity
- Vendor Lock-in
- Limited Control (except private clouds)
-  Sense of Security


Public Deployment Model
- Accessible by public
- Offers networking services, compute virtualisation & storage over the public internet 
- Very cost-effective
- No set-up or maintenance costs.
- Not very Secure

Private
- Managed and used by a single organization
- Offers great control over the data and resources
- More expensive than public cloud
- Higher level of security


Community model
- similiar to public cloud but offers it's services to a specific set of users who share a common objective/interest
- Managed internally or by third-party vendors 
- Cheaper and more efficient than the public cloud
- Not so popular so not available across many industries

Hybrid
- Combination of two or more models and offer flexible services
- Cost effective as it can use public model too
- A little complex to set-up
- Critical use cases
- High level of security as it can use the public cloud too




Three Types of Service Models

- SaaS -is a software as a service, it is a way of  delivering applications over the internet as a service. Instead of installing and maintaining software, you simply access it via the internet, freeing yourself from complex software and hardware management. Ex : Cisco WebEx, Google Apps. 
- IaaS - is a form of cloud computing that provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. Example : Azure, AWS
- PaaS - is a cloud computing model where a third party provider delivers hardware and software tools to users over the internet. Usually, these tools are needed for application development. Examples of PaaS : Google App Engine, AWS Elastic beanstalk
